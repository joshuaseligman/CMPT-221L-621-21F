# Assignment 1

This project is a basic landing page of a community news and social media site. This website mostly consists of HTML and CSS and a little bit of Bootstrap for some of the pre-built classes in the library. This project is only the front-end of the application and, therefore, does not contain any JavaScript.

While building the website, I was primarily challenged with trying to make the website look consistent on as many browsers and screen sizes as possible. To solve this issue, I made use of the flex property in CSS to ensure each section of the website took up a consistent amount of space as well as the rem unit for font sizes to make sure text was not too big or too small on other devices.

To view the website, download the repository with all of the files and just open the `index.html` file.
